# EnumLike

A hybrid of sealed traits with `Enumeration`-like properties. The best of both worlds!

Includes play-json formats and Play path/query string binders, as well as scalikejdbc binders.

## Usage

See the tests for details.

sbt:

```
"com.m3" %% "enumlike" % "0.6"
```

See `version.sbt` for latest version.
